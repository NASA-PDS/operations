        <description>The Lunar Prospector attitude data set consists of values for the
            spacecraft spin rate and spin axis orientation (attitude) as a
            function of time. These values are determined from spacecraft
            attitude data (sun and limb crossing sensors) and ephemeris data.
            Spacecraft orientations are given as right ascension and
            declination of the spacecraft spin axis in the Mean-of-J2000
            Ecliptic reference frame. The attitude data set consists of a
            single, cumulative file for the entire mission. Records are added
            to this file following each significant change in either the spin
            rate or spin axis orientation. The spacecraft spin rates and
            attitudes in this data set are orbit averages. The instantaneous
            spin rate can be determined from the sun pulse data set. The
            instantaneous spin rate varies as the spacecraft passes into and
            out of the Moon's shadow and after each spacecraft maneuver.
            Generally, an attitude record is included for times immediately
            before and after each maneuver.</description>

        <description>The command file data set contains a record of all commands sent
            to the Lunar Prospector spacecraft. The command files document
            any changes in spacecraft and science instrument operating modes
            or other settings. The files are ASCII text records of the
            commands and associated parameters. A complete list of spacecraft
            commands can be found in Appendix B of the Level 0 Data Product
            SIS, which is included in the Lunar Prospector Level 0 Data
            archive.</description>

        <description>The sun pulse data set is a record of times that the Lunar
            Prospector sun sensor detects the Sun. These sun pulse times are
            derived from ground processing of the sun sensor data, earth-moon
            limb sensor data, and the spacecraft ephemeris. This data set is
            part of the Lunar Prospector Level 0 data archive. The sun pulse
            times are used in determining the spacecraft spin rate and
            orientation as a function of time. Because the Lunar Prospector
            spacecraft is sometimes in eclipse with the Sun, the sun pulse
            data set is generated on the ground to include both actual sun
            pulse times based on the sun sensor measurements and estimated
            sun pulse times based on the history of spin rate change during
            all prior eclipses.</description>
